# How it works:
It stores all data in local storage so that we can use use our data when we restart or refresh the site.
When we enters the name of site and url of that site it stores it in a list and show up three buttons. <br>
=> Visit <br>
=> Edit <br>
=> Delete <br>
When we click visit button it takes us to to that site.<br>
Edit button is used to edit the url of name of site <br>
Delete buttons deletes the sites from the list.

# addEventListner: <br>
The addEventListener () is an inbuilt function in JavaScript which takes the event to listen for, and <br> a second argument to be called whenever the described event gets fired. Any number of event handlers can be added <br> to a single element without overwriting existing event handlers. <br>

# QuerrySelector: <br>
The querySelector () method of JavaScript is used for selecting only the first element from the code. <br. But what in case we want to retain more than one CSS selector value from the code. So, for such a case, we use another method of <br> the Document interface, which is known < as the querySelectorAll () method. <br>

# Local Storage: <br>
 LocalStorage is a data storage type of web storage. This allows the JavaScript sites and apps to store and <br> access the data without any expiration date. This means that the data will always be persisted and will not expire. <br> So, data stored in the browser will be available  even after closing the browser window. <br>

# How it works:
It stores all data in local storage so that we can use use our data when we restart or refresh the site.
When we enters the name of site and url of that site it stores it in a list and show up three buttons.
=> Visit <br>
=> Edit <br>
=> Delete <br>
When we click visit button it takes us to to that site.<br>
Edit button is used to edit the url of name of site <br>
Delete buttons deletes the sites from the list.
